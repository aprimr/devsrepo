# 🧑‍💻 DevsRepo

**DevsRepo** is a modern platform for developers to **publish, manage, and showcase their apps** — completely free.  
It was founded with a single mission: **to give app developers a place to share their creations without paying huge fees**.

---

## 💡 The Story Behind DevsRepo

DevsRepo was founded because **app developers often struggle to publish their apps** on platforms like Google Play or the App Store —  
where uploading even a small project requires paying expensive fees.

That’s why **DevsRepo exists** — a **completely free, developer-focused hub** where anyone can share their apps, projects, or tools openly with the world.

It is **built and maintained entirely by [areg](https://aprimregmi.com.np)** — a solo developer passionate about helping others showcase their work.

## 🌍 What is DevsRepo?

DevsRepo is your personal **developer portfolio + app management dashboard**.  
From uploading your app to managing updates and analytics — DevsRepo gives you a single, elegant space to do it all.

Think of it as **your own Play Store, made for developers — free, modern, and community-driven.**
